# Barrier Defense Cooldown Configuration (MCM)

This mod will allow you to control certain aspects regarding the Army Warehouse "Barrier Defense" mission in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly:
- Change the amount of days before the game tries to give you the next Barrier Defense
- Change the amount of days needed after a fresh save before the game decides to start giving you Barrier Defense
- Change whether or not Barrier Defense missions are "repeatable" (you will be able to get these missions again even after completing one or both of them)
- Pick which Barrier Defense you want to receive when rolled: Monolith, Zombies, both, or neither (_**Neither will result in no Barrier Defense ever happening**_)
- Change the chance that a Barrier Defense will occur whenever the game checks for a Barrier Defense event

*NOTE: When changing your MCM settings, you either need to go to a new level OR reload your save after making your changes*

This was originally made to allow Invictus/normal speedrunners to have some control over their runs. This can allow them to possibly get a faster progression route and avoid some RNG if said speedrunner can survive the mission. I added the "repeatable" option for myself.
